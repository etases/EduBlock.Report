## Background
Keeping track of and managing student records is typically time-consuming and challenging, needing approval from the school and certain permissible circumstances. When transferring transcripts from high school to university, this causes difficulties. When applying to universities based only on their transcripts, students must request permission from the institution in order to be given a temporary transcript, which is both time-consuming and inconvenient. My group then developed the concept for a web application that enables students to monitor their academic progress over the course of their education. In order to make the academic records stand out and add additional features to the web app that improve user experience, we used the Blockchain platform.

## Existing Systems
In the project, we use 4 main systems
  1.	Blockchain and Node system
  2.	Smart contract
  3.	Request server and client server
  4.	OCR

### Blockchain and Node system
Blockchain, at its heart, is a distributed digital ledger that houses all types of data. The ownership of NFTs, bitcoin transactions, and smart contract definitions can all be recorded on a blockchain.

This type of data may be stored in any conventional database, but blockchain is distinct since it is totally decentralized. The blockchain database is held on numerous computers dispersed throughout the network, as opposed to being kept in one place by a centralized administrator. These solitary machines are referred as nodes.

Blockchains can be public or private. Anyone can participate in a public blockchain, which allows them to access, write, or verify data on the blockchain. Because there is no single organization in charge of all the blockchain's nodes, it is challenging to alter transactions that have been recorded on a public blockchain.

A private blockchain, however, is managed by a company or group. Only that company or group has the authority to select users for the system, after which it has the right to modify the blockchain. Similar to an internal data storage system, this private blockchain procedure is spread over numerous nodes for added protection.

The following are some benefits of blockchain should be mentioned:

  •	Transactions are more accurate since a blockchain transaction requires numerous nodes to verify it. This can reduce mistakes.
  
  •	Absence of Middlemen Using blockchain, two parties to a transaction can confirm and finish it directly amongst themselves.
  
  •	Additional Protection: Theoretically, it is nearly impossible to conduct fraudulent transactions on a decentralized network like blockchain. They would have to hack each node and alter each piece of data in the ledger in order to carry out fraudulent transactions.

Despite its many benefits, blockchain still has the following drawbacks:

  •	Limit on Transactions Per Second: Because Blockchain relies on a broader network to authorize transactions, its speed is constrained.
  
  •	Risk of Asset Loss: Some digital assets, like cryptocurrencies in a blockchain wallet, are safeguarded using a cryptographic key. This key needs to be properly guarded. There is presently no means to recover a private cryptographic key that grants access to a digital asset, thus the asset will be lost forever if the owner misplaces it.


### Smart contract
Smart Contract is a computer program, or a transaction protocol designed to automatically carry out, manage, and record legally significant events and activities in accordance with the conditions of a contract or agreement.

Simply said, a stored program is run on the blockchain under predetermined conditions, ensuring that users receive immediate results free from the influence of middlemen.

Smart Contracts are written as code on the blockchain and work with a straightforward "if/when... then..." statement. A network of computers that will act when a verification condition is satisfied.

Only parties who have been given permission may access the results; the transaction cannot be changed at will. If so, they must develop guidelines for dealing, trade standards, planning for all potential deviations, and dispute resolution. The signing of the contract will be more successful as a result of the participants' satisfaction.

Pros:

  •	When compared to using conventional contracts, smart contracts sometimes help save time and money.

  •	High security means that data is virtually completely safe.

  •	Because a smart contract is a collection of programmable code, developers can quickly alter and construct it into numerous contracts to accommodate various kinds of services and goods.

  •	Furthermore, because Smart Contracts are decentralized systems, they cannot be hampered by outside parties. This contributes to greater operational efficiency, reduced operating expenses, and increased transparency.

Cons:

  •	The information in the contract is essentially unchangeable because it is kept on a ledger. If the parties decide to alter some of the terms of the contract, this is advantageous but also disadvantageous.

  •	It is difficult for hackers to attack since the system is very secure, unaffected by intermediaries, and data protection is guaranteed, but this also implies that it will be challenging to fix.


### Request server and client server
A computer network paradigm with a client and a server as its two major parts. The server serves as the location for storing resources, setting up service applications, and handling client requests in this approach. The client is responsible for submitting the server's request.

Provides the network with the ability to concentrate applications and operations into one or more specific file services. Additionally enables simultaneous usage of the same resource by users, independent of their location.

Pros:

  •	Ensure data integrity in case of errors.

  •	Expanding your network is simple.

  •	Possesses the capacity to withstand network overload.


### OCR
Optical Character Recognition is referred to as OCR. This specialized software program reads text from picture files. This technology is used to transfer and enter data. It is referred to as a digital scanning instrument that specializes in identifying characters, handwriting, or written letters.

A printed or handwritten page that is scanned using OCR is saved in the TIF file format. This graphic underneath the display is clear and easy to read. However, a sequence of images with either white or black dots will be present, depending on the computer. To check whether the markers match, the technology now examines each line of the image.

Pros:

  •	OCR can scan and interpret words on a screen, which will be helpful to the blind and visually impaired. People with eyesight impairments can readily understand things from here.

  •	Fast data entry: OCR ensures functionality to increase productivity and office job efficiency. The demand to scan papers is growing because the majority of people work in offices. By doing this, users will benefit from time savings and accurate, timely data updates.

Cons:

  •	On the basis of clear photos, the majority of OCR software and applications can only reliably recognize roughly 80–90% of documents.

  •	OCR is challenging to identify because the accessible images include backgrounds and text that are similar in colour.


## Business Opportunity
Although many high schools in Vietnam still keep paper records for post-graduation and enrolment in college or university, many now employ an online system to track students' academic progress and inform parents of any latest outcomes. Because they must do it for both the paper records and the internet system, teachers find it challenging to update the information on their students. There is also a minimum level of transparency for students who wish to verify their information at any time because the internet system is centralized and only administrators and teachers have access to it. As a result, a system is required to help teachers and students manage student records in an easier, quicker, and more effective manner. 

## Software Product Vision
With the use of this system, students may simply keep track of changes to their grades in their academic records, reducing teacher grade entry errors. In order to gain rapid admission to graduate programs and colleges, students can also more conveniently retrieve their transcripts. High security and restrictions on data editing also assist in limiting the issue of phony points that are inaccurate representations of reality. Additionally, it eliminates challenges with entering grades into instructors' school records because doing so will be quicker and easier with the aid of the system.

## Project Scope & Limitations
A record management system will always be the best in terms of security and purity because it must, of course, assure data security. When interacting with and storing the data, always keep it intact and unaltered. Additionally, it must be user-friendly, with an interface that is clear and unambiguous and avoids misinterpretations of the translation or the information on the screen. Without the responsible user's consent, data editing procedures cannot be carried out at will.

### Major Features
FE-01:  Using the blockchain platform, store data.

FE-02:  Transcripts can be updated by converting photos to alphanumeric data.

FE-03:  May replace paper school records entirely (electronic school records but have the nature of paper school records).

FE-04:  Enhancing the effort teachers put into entering grades.

FE-05:  Utilization dependability for admissions parties.

### Limitations & Exclusions
LI-1: It is impossible to synchronize student counts between institutions due to the dispersed nature of the data.

LI-2: The only time to use the system is at the end of the year because it only saves the semester's overall grade (can be expanded later)

LI-3: There is no option to switch schools (due to not processing student codes synchronously)
