    "text": "1.2 Background\nKeeping track of and managing student records is typically time-consuming and challenging, needing approval from the school and certain permissible circumstances. When transferring transcripts from high school to university, this causes difficulties. When applying to universities based only on their transcripts, students must request permission from the institution in order to be given a temporary transcript, which is both time-consuming and inconvenient. My group then developed the concept for a web application that enables students to monitor their academic progress over the course of their education. In order to make the academic records stand out and add additional features to the web app that improve user experience, we used the Blockchain platform."

    "text": "1.3 Existing Systems\nIn the project, we use 4 main systems 1. Blockchain and Node system 2. Smart contract 3. Request server and client server 4. OCR\n\n1.3.1 Blockchain and Node system\nBlockchain, at its heart, is a distributed digital ledger that houses all types of data. The ownership of NFTs, bitcoin transactions, and smart contract definitions can all be recorded on a blockchain.\nThis type of data may be stored in any conventional database, but blockchain is distinct since it is totally decentralized. The blockchain database is held on numerous computers dispersed throughout the network, as opposed to being kept in one place by a centralized administrator. These solitary machines are referred as nodes.\nBlockchains can be public or private. Anyone can participate in a public blockchain, which allows them to access, write, or verify data on the blockchain. Because there is no single organization in charge of all the blockchain’s nodes, it is challenging to alter transactions that have been recorded on a public blockchain.\nA private blockchain, however, is managed by a company or group. Only that company or group has the authority to select users for the system, after which it has the right to modify the blockchain. Similar to an internal data storage system, this private blockchain procedure is spread over numerous nodes for added protection.\nThe following are some benefits of blockchain should be mentioned:\n• Transactions are more accurate since a blockchain transaction requires numerous nodes to verify it. This can reduce mistakes.\n• Absence of Middlemen Using blockchain, two parties to a transaction can confirm and finish it directly amongst themselves.\n• Additional Protection: Theoretically, it is nearly impossible to conduct fraudulent transactions on a decentralized network like blockchain. They would have to hack each node and alter each piece of data in the ledger in order to carry out fraudulent transactions.\nDespite its many benefits, blockchain still has the following drawbacks:\n• Limit on Transactions Per Second: Because Blockchain relies on a broader network to authorize transactions, its speed is constrained.\n• Risk of Asset Loss: Some digital assets, like cryptocurrencies in a blockchain wallet, are safeguarded using a cryptographic key. This key needs to be properly guarded. There is presently no means to recover a private cryptographic key that grants access to a digital asset, thus the asset will be lost forever if the owner misplaces it.\n\n\n1.3.2 Smart contract\nSmart Contract is a computer program, or a transaction protocol designed to automatically carry out, manage, and record legally significant events and activities in accordance with the conditions of a contract or agreement.\nSimply said, a stored program is run on the blockchain under predetermined conditions, ensuring that users receive immediate results free from the influence of middlemen.\nSmart Contracts are written as code on the blockchain and work with a straightforward “if/when… then…” statement. A network of computers that will act when a verification condition is satisfied.\nOnly parties who have been given permission may access the results; the transaction cannot be changed at will. If so, they must develop guidelines for dealing, trade standards, planning for all potential deviations, and dispute resolution. The signing of the contract will be more successful as a result of the participants’ satisfaction.\nPros:\n• When compared to using conventional contracts, smart contracts sometimes help save time and money.\n• High security means that data is virtually completely safe.\n• Because a smart contract is a collection of programmable code, developers can quickly alter and construct it into numerous contracts to accommodate various kinds of services and goods.\n• Furthermore, because Smart Contracts are decentralized systems, they cannot be hampered by outside parties. This contributes to greater operational efficiency, reduced operating expenses, and increased transparency.\nCons:\n• The information in the contract is essentially unchangeable because it is kept on a ledger. If the parties decide to alter some of the terms of the contract, this is advantageous but also disadvantageous.\n• It is difficult for hackers to attack since the system is very secure, unaffected by intermediaries, and data protection is guaranteed, but this also implies that it will be challenging to fix.\n\n\n1.3.3 Request server and client server\nA computer network paradigm with a client and a server as its two major parts. The server serves as the location for storing resources, setting up service applications, and handling client requests in this approach. The client is responsible for submitting the server’s request.\nProvides the network with the ability to concentrate applications and operations into one or more specific file services. Additionally enables simultaneous usage of the same resource by users, independent of their location.\nPros:\n• Ensure data integrity in case of errors.\n• Expanding your network is simple.\n• Possesses the capacity to withstand network overload.\n\n\n1.3.4 OCR\nOptical Character Recognition is referred to as OCR. This specialized software program reads text from picture files. This technology is used to transfer and enter data. It is referred to as a digital scanning instrument that specializes in identifying characters, handwriting, or written letters.\nA printed or handwritten page that is scanned using OCR is saved in the TIF file format. This graphic underneath the display is clear and easy to read. However, a sequence of images with either white or black dots will be present, depending on the computer. To check whether the markers match, the technology now examines each line of the image.\nPros:\n• OCR can scan and interpret words on a screen, which will be helpful to the blind and visually impaired. People with eyesight impairments can readily understand things from here.\n• Fast data entry: OCR ensures functionality to increase productivity and office job efficiency. The demand to scan papers is growing because the majority of people work in offices. By doing this, users will benefit from time savings and accurate, timely data updates.\nCons:\n• On the basis of clear photos, the majority of OCR software and applications can only reliably recognize roughly 80–90% of documents.\n• OCR is challenging to identify because the accessible images include backgrounds and text that are similar in colour."

    "text": "1.4 Business Opportunity\nAlthough many high schools in Vietnam still keep paper records for post-graduation and enrolment in college or university, many now employ an online system to track students’ academic progress and inform parents of any latest outcomes. Because they must do it for both the paper records and the internet system, teachers find it challenging to update the information on their students. There is also a minimum level of transparency for students who wish to verify their information at any time because the internet system is centralized and only administrators and teachers have access to it. As a result, a system is required to help teachers and students manage student records in an easier, quicker, and more effective manner."

In order to gain rapid admission to graduate programs and colleges, students can also more conveniently retrieve their transcripts. High security and restrictions on data editing also assist in limiting the issue of phony points that are inaccurate representations of reality. Additionally, it eliminates challenges with entering grades into instructors’ school records because doing so will be quicker and easier with the aid of the system."

    "text": "1.6 Project Scope & Limitations\nA record management system will always be the best in terms of security and purity because it must, of course, assure data security. When interacting with and storing the data, always keep it intact and unaltered. Additionally, it must be user-friendly, with an interface that is clear and unambiguous and avoids misinterpretations of the translation or the information on the screen. Without the responsible user’s consent, data editing procedures cannot be carried out at will.\n\n1.6.1 Major Features\nFE-01: Using the blockchain platform, store data.\nFE-02: Transcripts can be updated by converting photos to alphanumeric data.\nFE-03: May replace paper school records entirely (electronic school records but have the nature of paper school records).\nFE-04: Enhancing the effort teachers put into entering grades.\nFE-05: Utilization dependability for admissions parties.\n\n\n1.6.2 Limitations & Exclusions\nLI-1: It is impossible to synchronize student counts between institutions due to the dispersed nature of the data.\nLI-2: The only time to use the system is at the end of the year because it only saves the semester’s overall grade (can be expanded later)\nLI-3: There is no option to switch schools (due to not processing student codes synchronously)"

Using this model, we can understand requirements, adapt changes quickly and deliver target products in a short time to test & review them for next iterations. The project will be divided into 4 iterations (sprints). Each sprint will be a month long and include 2 phases: planning and development. The planning phase will be used to estimate tasks from the product backlog, create a sprint backlog and assign tasks to the team members to develop in the development phase. At the end of the sprint, the team will review the sprint, discuss the problems and changes during the sprint and plan for the next sprint.\n\n\n2.2.2 Quality Management\n\nReviewing: There will be a meeting every week for the team and the supervisor to review the status of the tasks in the current sprint. The team will show the progress of the tasks and discuss the problems and changes during the sprint. The supervisor will take notes and give advices to the team.\nDefect Prevention: Each change of the code should be reviewed by the code master or the team leader before applying to the main project. They will check for bugs, code smells, anti-patterns and other problems.\nUnit Testing: Each module of the system should be tested before applying to the main project. The team can test the module by themselves or use a testing framework / software to test the module.\nIntegration Testing: The team will test the system after each sprint to make sure that the system is working properly. There will be an automatic testing software that includes test scenarios for the system.\nSystem Testing: The team will test the completed system based on the requirements and the test scenarios.

EduBlock is an web-application that will help the school to manage their student’s records, more specifically, the students and teachers can reduce paper’s work to manage their records. Lately, the school has been using paper to manage their student’s record, which is not efficient and not environmental friendly. EduBlock will help the school to manage their student’s records in a more efficient way, although there are some other 3rd party applications that can help school to keep their student’s records nowdays, but it is not really efficient and safe, our application use blockchain technology to make sure the data is safe and secure. Every step of the process that need to be work with the records will be tracked by EduBlock, so the school can easily track the data changes and make sure the data is not being tampered.\n\n\n3.1.2 Business Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nRules Description\n\n\n\n\nBR-1\nThe application will be used by the students, teachers, staff and admin.\n\n\nBR-2\nOnly Staff have permission to manage classroom including create new class, edit class, assign or remove teacher from the class, assign student to class, remove student from class, edit student information.\n\n\nBR-3\nOnly Admin have permission to create new account(s).\n\n\nBR-4\nOnly Teacher who teach the subject can edit the grade of the student.\n\n\nBR-5\nStudent can only view their class, profile and academic record.\n\n\nBR-6\nIn Blockchain, the data is immutable, so the data cannot be changed once it is created.

Other users can only access the system through the frontend server.\nThe blockchain is a private blockchain.\nThe blockchain is an optional feature that can be turned on or off.\nThe database is a H2 database.\nThe mode of the database can be in-memory (for testing), file or remote (for production).\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Design Constraints\n\nThe backend system is a REST API server.\nThe backend system is a Java application.\nThe blockchain is a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.\nThere should be an option to turn on or off the blockchain. If the blockchain is turned off, the backend system should still work as a normal REST API server with a local database.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Technology Suggestion\n\nThe endpoints of the backend system can be exposed so that a node browser can be developed to search & access the endpoints and get the necessary information."

    "text": "5.1 Overall Description\n\n5.1.1 Test Model\nWe apply the V-model in our project, which is a development of the waterfall model. Testing is carried out concurrently with the software development cycle in the V-model, where a testing phase corresponds to a phase of software development.\n\n\n5.1.2 Testing Levels\nAbout the Testing levels in our project, we apply all those levels including Unit testing, Integration testing, System testing and Acceptance testing.\nWith Unit testing, we test each small module in the system, each class and function. Eg (………)\nWith Integration testing is a type of testing in which individual software modules or functions are logically integrated and tested in groups together. For instance, we can test the interoperability of two functions, add 1 item and search for the item to see if they interact well with each other, after successfully creating an item, we can proceed to search for the newly created item. or not.\nSystem testing is the last test phase to determine whether the system is about to deliver satisfying the requirements and goals. It tests the whole functionality and interface of the system. For instance, a database test for a system test is used to see if the data displayed on the system matches the data in the database.\nFinally, with Acceptance Test, similar to System Test but usually tested by customers, the purpose is to see if the software meets the customer’s requirements or not.\n\n\n5.1.3 Testing Types\nFunctional testing is checking if the system is working according to the business requirements and is performed in every level of testing. Non-Functional testing is similar to Functional testing in that both occur in all levels of testing. Non-functional testing is primarily concerned with the software’s other features, such as its security and if data is exposed by straightforward queries in any input field. Structural testing is often considered a type of white box testing. Instead than focusing on the software’s functionality, this method examines what is happening inside the program. Structural testing is also applicable at all testing levels. Changes Testing is done to determine whether or not the program is functioning correctly after bugs have been fixed."
